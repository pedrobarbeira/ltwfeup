        <h2>A New Semester at FEUP</h2>
        <main>
            <article><p>A new semester just started in the Faculty of
                Engineering of the University of Porto! This
                semester will bring many challenges and, hopefully,
                many chances for success as well.
            </p>
            <p>Our Engineers are set and ready to go. There's a mew
                archdemon in campus - one that's particularly noisy
                and hard to deal with. Many students have been trying
                to tear down this old fiend since the start of the 
                school year, but had no avail in it.
            </p>
            <p>
                Fortunately, the new courses this semester focus on 
                just that. With a new developed technology, developed
                by FEUP's graduate students, our hopes rose up again.
                We expect to trap this archfiend into a vessel, in 
                order to contain it's negative impact on it's surroundings.
                Through the use of top quality materials and high-end
                tech, the chaotic energies of this demon will be put to
                good use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The basis of the tech is similar to what we can find in 
                nuclear powerplants all over the world. By poking it with 
                a stick, we expect to incur it's anger, making it growl 
                and try to attack us with it's fiery breath. Once the 
                flames start pouring out, they'll be directed through a 
                state of the art adamantium pipe, heating up water, which 
                in turn will boil. The vapors will rotate a turbine, thus 
                generating energy.
            </p>
            <p>
                We expect that the transmutation of this archfiend will 
                provide enough energy to power the whole campus of the 
                Univeristy of Porto for a whole semester! And we have to 
                thank our amazing students here at FEUP for making this 
                dream a reality.
            </p>

                    This is wonderful! I've never expected, in my whole 
                    life, to see such a fenomenal display of technical
                    prowess and ability in such a comprised and focused 
                    manner. Very well done!

                    As an active member of the FiendNoMoar Community, I'm 
                    very proud of being included in this joint effort to 
                    turn something bad into something positive. Just goes 
                    to show how powerful our intentions can be.
